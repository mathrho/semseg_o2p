This is a customized version of LIBLINEAR 1.5, with some differences.

Positive:
- Dense format, incorporated from the code in: http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smaji/projects/digits/
- Instance weights (which was in some special liblinear version).
- Can handle 4x more data than the original, in MATLAB, given the same memory budget:
	- Single precision (allows for 2x as much data for the same amount of RAM).
	- No duplication of the MATLAB inputs (allows for 2x as much data for the same amount of RAM).
- Incorporated the regression code from LIBLINEAR 1.9.
- Allows for learning with warm starting  (by providing an input alpha vector).

Negative:
- Disregarded and damaged some of the other functionalities. Only classification 
and regression with l2 regularization and dual formulation work (these are the fastest anyway).
